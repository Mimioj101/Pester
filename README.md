Pester is a dating app that allows you to match with the cockroach of your dreams! You can create and edit your profile with a picture, a short bio, your age, and what you look for in a cockroach. You can sign up or log in on the landing page. You can peruse through all of our tantilizing cockroaches and match with the ones you want based on their location, species, bio, and dowry. You can look at all of your matches from your profile page and even tweet your match if you would like to let the world know! If you grow tired of your cockroach match, you can always unmatch and search for a more compatible roach.


This app uses Ruby 2.7.1 and Ruby on Rails web framework.
